# Oxide-Installer

# What is it?

This project is a simple windows server side application what allows the administator who runs a rust server to manage their server more easily. Overall its a small utility tool what allows the user to automatically download, extract and install the Rust Oxide Mod to a defined location (Usually the rust server files directory) set by the user. The goal of the project was to attempt to automate the Oxide Mod installation for rust server administrators as Oxide Mod updates get released quite often requiring the Oxide Mod to be manually downloaded, extracted and installed in the root server directory (Rust server directory) each time a new update is released.

# Features:
