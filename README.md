# Oxide-Installer

# What is it?

This project is a simple windows server side application what allows the administator who runs a rust server to quickly download, extract and install the latest oxide mod to the selected server path (Which would be the rust server directory usually) automatically.

# How to install?

Well at the current moment its a simple double click or open and its ready to use on the server.

# Development status:

The project is still in development and possibly will be until I run out of features to implement, feel I done enough on this project for a functionaly simple use or I have moved onto a new project idea (as I quite a few ideas flowing in my head).

# Planned features:

1. Server wipe feature for admins to wipe their server with a simple click of a button.

2. Application installer for the server side application. (This is if the application has got quite a few features and requires a installer).

3. Save feature, so user setting will save on application close.

4. Automation feature, what allows the admin to set a schedule for server wipes to be done or oxide mod download which would be done automatically.
