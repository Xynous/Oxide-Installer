# Planned features:

1. Server wipe feature for admins to wipe their rust save files. Looking into creating mini ui file explorer for users to easly set sav file locations and interact within the utility to perform tasks like deleting sav files, moving them etc. (Still in research and testing).

2. Save feature, so user setting will save on application close. (Done)
