# Oxide-Installer

# What is it?

This project is a simple windows server side application what allows the administator who runs a rust server to manage their server more easily. Overall its a small utility tool what offers features such as, mod downloading of oxide, automatic extraction of mod to specific location and a simple file delete which could be used to delte your rust (sav) files on server wipes.

# How to install?

Well at the current moment its a simple double click or open and its ready to use on the server.

# Development status:

The project is still in development and possibly will be until I run out of features to implement, feel I done enough on this project for a functional simple use or I have moved onto a new project idea (as I quite a few ideas flowing in my head).

# Planned features:

1. Server wipe feature for admins to wipe their server with a simple click of a button. (Done, needs to be reviewed)

2. Application installer for the server side application. (This is if the application has got quite a few features and requires a installer).

3. Save feature, so user setting will save on application close. (Done)

4. Automation feature, what allows the admin to set a schedule for server wipes to be done or oxide mod download which would be done automatically. (WIP)

5. Optional downloads (This is basically allows the user to download custom mod files like oxide mod or offcial rust updates from steamcmd for example. (Still considering)
