# Oxide-Installer

# What is it?

This project is a simple windows server side application what allows the administator who runs a rust server to manage their server more easily. Overall its a small utility tool what offers features such as, mod downloading of oxide, automatic extraction of mod to specific location and a simple file delete which could be used to delte your rust (sav) files on server wipes.

# How to install?

Well at the current moment its a simple double click or open and its ready to use on the server.

# Development status:

The project is still in development and possibly will be until I run out of features to implement, feel I done enough on this project for a functional simple use or I have moved onto a new project idea (as I quite a few ideas flowing in my head).

# Planned features:

1. Server wipe feature for admins to wipe their rust save files. Looking into creating mini ui file explorer for users to easly set sav file locations and interact within the utility to perform tasks like deleting sav files, moving them etc. (Still in research and testing).

2. Application installer for the server side application. (This is if the application has got quite a few features and requires a installer).

3. Save feature, so user setting will save on application close. (Done)

4. Automation feature, what allows the admin to set a schedule for server wipes to be done or oxide mod download which would be done automatically. (WIP)

5. Optional downloads (This is basically allows the user to download custom mod files like oxide mod or offcial rust updates from steamcmd for example. (Still considering)

6. Multiple profiles when managaing multiple rust servers by allowing the user to create a new section with a press of a button. This will create a new section such as the the paramater boxes, download buttons etc which users can set a second, third or fourth configuration if running multiple servers. Also need to make this create new variables dynamiically and adjust form and form object positions on multiple profile creation.

7. Service creation within windows. This will maintain the uptime of the rust server utility and if crashes, it will recover the application.

8. GUI (Graphical user interface) needs to be redesigned once functionality is developed.
